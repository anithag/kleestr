== metaSMT toolbox ==
This folder is meant for small projects that use metaSMT. 
All subfolders are automatically compiled into executables with the current build configuration.

== How to make a new project ==

# copy the example project
cp -r simple new_project

# or copy a project with custom CMakeLists.txt
cp -r sudoku new_project
# specify the correct dependencies
edit new_project/CMakeLists.txt


# and tell cmake to pick up new projects
cd build
make rebuild_cache


== Reference and Guidance ==
The sudoku/ and guess_mastermind/ folders both show the basic usage of 
metaSMT.

The use of all metaSMT expressions is also demonstrated in the tests folder of
metaSMT.
