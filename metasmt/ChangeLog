  * SymbolTable: Custom names for variables (SMT2 output)
  * AssignRandomBits: select a random subset of bits from BitVector
    variables and assign a random value
  * SAT API (add_clause): directly add clauses to the backend
* Type Descriptors and TypedSymbols (Boolean, BitVector)
* Preliminary support for QF_UF (only unary functions)
* Portfolio and Priority Multi-Threaded solving
* toolbox example N-Queens using cardinality constraints
* toolbox contains a CNF solver
